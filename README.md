# A Quick Webpack Tutorial

This is a non exhaustive, iterative tutorial to introduce the basics of my current webpack workflow. Starting with a tiny sample project, we'll layer on various bits of webpack functionality to add things such as SASS/CSS modules and live reloading.

## Installation

Once you have this repo checked out in a local directory, the tutorial has directions for installing each module/loader as needed. However, to save time you may install all of the dependencies up front.

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Running The Examples

Each step coincides with a part of the tutorial, and builds on the previous step. The example commands are intended to be run from inside of the step folder. [Read the tutorial](TUTORIAL.md).
